This interactive dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data for the current and previous years. It is designed to provide actionable insights into accident severity, types, and patterns to support safety initiatives and decision-making.
This belongs entirely to Data Tutorial channelâ€”but I used it as a resource to enhance my skills in Tableau.
